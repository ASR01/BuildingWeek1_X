Description:	The current human speed record is shared equally by the trio of astronauts who flew Nasa's Apollo 10 mission. On their way back from a lap around the Moon in 1969, the astronauts' capsule hit a peak of 24,790mph (39,897km/h) relative to planet Earth. But this video does include all spacecraft and spaceships from TV series, Movies, Games, and NASA, which means all real and fictional spaceships.
