Typo correction: At 6:52, the screen shows
[x1, y1] + [x2, y2] = [x1+y1, x2+y2]. 
Of course, this should actually be 
[x1, y1] + [x2, y2] = [x1+x2, y1+y2].

Transcription:
 0:00	-	"The introduction of numbers as coordinatesis an act of violence."
0:09	-	—Hermann Weyl
0:11	-	The fundamental, root-of-it-all building blockfor linear algebra is the vector, so it's
0:16	-	worth
0:17	-	making sure that we're all on the same pageabout what exactly a vector is.
0:19	-	You see, broadly
0:21	-	speaking there are three distinct but relatedideas about vectors, which I'll call the physics
0:25	-	student perspective, the computer sciencestudent perspective, and the mathematician's
0:29	-	perspective.
0:30	-	The physics student perspective is that vectorsare arrows pointing in space.
0:35	-	What defines a given
0:36	-	vector is its length, and the direction it'spointing in, but as long as those two facts
0:40	-	are the
0:41	-	same, you can move it all around and it'sstill the same vector.
0:44	-	Vectors that live in the flat plane
0:45	-	are two-dimensional, and those sitting inbroader space that you and I live in are three-dimensional.
0:51	-	The computer science perspective is that vectorsare ordered lists of numbers.
0:56	-	For example, let's
0:57	-	say that you were doing some analytics abouthouse prices, and the only features you cared
1:01	-	about
1:02	-	were square footage and price.
1:03	-	You might model each house with a pair ofnumbers: the first
1:06	-	indicating square footage, and the secondindicating price.
1:09	-	Notice that the order matters here.
1:12	-	In the lingo, you'd be modelling houses astwo-dimensional vectors, where in this context,
1:17	-	"vector" is pretty much just a fancy wordfor "list", and what makes it two-dimensional
1:21	-	is the fact
1:22	-	that the length of that list is 2.
1:25	-	The mathematician, on the other hand, seeksto generalise both of these views, basically
1:30	-	saying that
1:31	-	a vector can be anything where there's a sensiblenotion of adding two vectors, and multiplying
1:35	-	a
1:36	-	vector by a number, operations that I'll talkabout later on in this video.
1:39	-	The details of this view
1:40	-	are rather abstract, and I actually thinkit's healthy to ignore it until the last video
1:44	-	of this
1:45	-	series, favoring a more concrete setting inthe interim,
1:48	-	but the reason that I bring it up here isthat it hints at the fact that ideas of vector
1:52	-	addition
1:53	-	and multiplication by numbers will play animportant role throughout linear algebra.
1:58	-	But before I talk about those operations,let's just settle in on a specific thought
2:01	-	to have in mind
2:02	-	when I say the word "vector".
2:04	-	Given the geometric focus that I'm shootingfor here, whenever I
2:07	-	introduce a new topic involving vectors, Iwant you to first think about an arrow—and
2:12	-	specifically,
2:13	-	think about that arrow inside a coordinatesystem, like the x-y plane, with its tail
2:18	-	sitting at the origin.
2:19	-	This is a little bit different from the physicsstudent perspective, where vectors can freely
2:23	-	sit
2:24	-	anywhere they want in space.
2:25	-	In linear algebra, it's almost always thecase that your vector will be
2:28	-	rooted at the origin.
2:30	-	Then, once you understand a new concept inthe context of arrows in space,
2:35	-	we'll translate it over to the list-of-numberspoint-of-view, which we can do by considering
2:39	-	the coordinates of the vector.
2:41	-	Now while I'm sure that many of you are familiarwith this coordinate system, it's worth walking
2:45	-	through explicitly, since this is where allof the important back-and-forth happens between
2:50	-	the two
2:51	-	perspectives of linear algebra.
2:52	-	Focusing our attention on two dimensions forthe moment, you have a
2:55	-	horizontal line, called the x-axis, and avertical line, called the y-axis.
3:00	-	The place where they
3:01	-	intersect is called the origin, which youshould think of as the center of space and
3:04	-	the root of all vectors.
3:06	-	After choosing an arbitrary length to represent1, you make tick-marks on each axis to
3:10	-	represent this distance.
3:12	-	When I want to convey the idea of 2-D spaceas a whole, which you'll see
3:15	-	comes up a lot in these videos, I'll extendthese tick-marks to make grid-lines, but right
3:19	-	now
3:20	-	they'll actually get a little bit in the way.
3:22	-	The coordinates of a vector is a pair of numbersthat
3:25	-	basically give instructions for how to getfrom the tail of that vector—at the origin—to
3:29	-	its tip.
3:30	-	The first number tells you how far to walkalong the x-axis—positive numbers indicating
3:35	-	rightward
3:36	-	motion, negative numbers indicating leftwardmotion—and the second number tell you how
3:39	-	far to walk
3:40	-	parallel to the y-axis after that—positivenumbers indicating upward motion, and negative
3:45	-	numbers
3:46	-	indicating downward motion.
3:48	-	To distinguish vectors from points, the conventionis to write this pair
3:51	-	of numbers vertically with square bracketsaround them.
3:56	-	Every pair of numbers gives you one and onlyone vector, and every vector is associated
4:01	-	with one and
4:02	-	only one pair of numbers.
4:04	-	What about in three dimensions?
4:05	-	Well, you add a third axis, called the z-axis,
4:09	-	which is perpendicular to both the x- andy-axes, and in this case each vector is associated
4:14	-	with an ordered triplet of numbers: the firsttells you how far to move along the x-axis,
4:19	-	the second
4:20	-	tells you how far to move parallel to they-axis, and the third one tells you how far
4:24	-	to then move
4:25	-	parallel to this new z-axis.
4:28	-	Every triplet of numbers gives you one uniquevector in space, and
4:32	-	every vector in space gives you exactly onetriplet of numbers.
4:37	-	So back to vector addition, and multiplicationby numbers.
4:40	-	After all, every topic in linear algebra
4:42	-	is going to center around these two operations.
4:45	-	Luckily, each one is pretty straightforwardto define.
4:48	-	Let's say we have two vectors, one pointingup, and a little to the right, and the other
4:52	-	one
4:53	-	pointing right, and down a bit.
4:54	-	To add these two vectors, move the secondone so that its tail sits
4:58	-	at the tip of the first one; then if you drawa new vector from the tail of the first one
5:04	-	to where
5:05	-	the tip of the second one now sits, that newvector is their sum.
5:12	-	This definition of addition, by the way, ispretty much the only time in linear algebra
5:16	-	where we let
5:17	-	vectors stray away from the origin.
5:19	-	Now why is this a reasonable thing to do?—Whythis definition of addition and not some other
5:23	-	one?
5:25	-	Well the way I like to think about it is thateach vector represents a certain movement—a
5:30	-	step with
5:31	-	a certain distance and direction in space.
5:34	-	If you take a step along the first vector,
5:36	-	then take a step in the direction and distancedescribed by the second vector, the overall
5:40	-	effect is
5:41	-	just the same as if you moved along the sumof those two vectors to start with.
5:45	-	You could think about this as an extensionof how we think about adding numbers on a
5:48	-	number line.
5:50	-	One way that we teach kids to think aboutthis, say with 2+5, is to think of moving
5:54	-	2 steps to the
5:55	-	right, followed by another 5 steps to theright.
5:58	-	The overall effect is the same as if you justtook
6:00	-	7 steps to the right.
6:02	-	In fact, let's see how vector addition looksnumerically.
6:06	-	The first vector
6:07	-	here has coordinates (1,2), and the secondone has coordinates (3,-1).
6:14	-	When you take the vector sum
6:15	-	using this tip-to-tail method, you can thinkof a four-step path from the origin to the
6:20	-	tip of the
6:21	-	second vector: "walk 1 to the right, then2 up, then 3 to the right, then 1 down."
6:26	-	Re-organising
6:27	-	these steps so that you first do all of therightward motion, then do all of the vertical
6:31	-	motion,
6:32	-	you can read it as saying, "first move 1+3to the right, then move 2+(-1) up," so the
6:40	-	new vector has
6:41	-	coordinates 1+3 and 2+(-1).
6:45	-	In general, vector addition in this list-of-numbersconception looks
6:49	-	like matching up their terms, and adding eachone together.
6:55	-	The other fundamental vector operation ismultiplication by a number.
6:58	-	Now this is best understood
6:59	-	just by looking at a few examples.
7:02	-	If you take the number 2, and multiply itby a given vector, it
7:05	-	means you stretch out that vector so thatit's 2 times as long as when you started.
7:10	-	If you multiply
7:11	-	that vector by, say, 1/3, it means you squishit down so that it's 1/3 of the original length.
7:17	-	When you multiply it by a negative number,like -1.8, then the vector first gets flipped
7:23	-	around,
7:24	-	then stretched out by that factor of 1.8.
7:27	-	This process of stretching or squishing orsometimes reversing the direction of a vector
7:31	-	is called "scaling",
7:33	-	and whenever you catch a number like 2 or1/3 or -1.8 acting like this—scaling some
7:39	-	vector—you call it a "scalar".
7:41	-	In fact, throughout linear algebra, one ofthe main things that
7:44	-	numbers do is scale vectors, so it's commonto use the word "scalar" pretty much interchangeably
7:50	-	with the word "number".
7:52	-	Numerically, stretching out a vector by afactor of, say, 2, corresponds to
7:56	-	multiplying each of its components by thatfactor, 2, so in the conception of vectors
8:01	-	as
8:02	-	lists of numbers, multiplying a given vectorby a scalar means multiplying each one of
8:06	-	those components by that scalar.
8:10	-	You'll see in the following videos what Imean when I say that linear algebra topics
8:14	-	tend to revolve
8:15	-	around these two fundamental operations: vectoraddition, and scalar multiplication; and I'll
8:20	-	talk
8:21	-	more in the last video about how and why themathematician thinks only about these operations,
8:25	-	independent and abstracted away from howeveryou choose to represent vectors.
8:29	-	In truth, it doesn't
8:30	-	matter whether you think about vectors asfundamentally being arrows in space—like
8:34	-	I'm suggesting
8:35	-	you do—that happen to have a nice numericalrepresentation, or fundamentally as lists
8:39	-	of numbers
8:40	-	that happen to have a nice geometric interpretation.
8:42	-	The usefulness of linear algebra has lessto do with
8:44	-	either one of these views than it does withthe ability to translate back and forth between
8:49	-	them.
8:50	-	It gives the data analyst a nice way to conceptualisemany lists of numbers in a visual way,
8:55	-	which can seriously clarify patterns in data,and give a global view of what certain operations
8:59	-	do,
9:00	-	and on the flip side, it gives people likephysicists and computer graphics programmers
9:04	-	a language
9:05	-	to describe space and the manipulation ofspace using numbers that can be crunched and
9:10	-	run through a computer.
9:12	-	When I do math-y animations, for example,I start by thinking about what's actually
9:16	-	going on in
9:17	-	space, and then get the computer to representthings numerically, thereby figuring out where
9:21	-	to
9:22	-	place the pixels on the screen, and doingthat usually relies on a lot of linear algebra
9:25	-	understanding.
9:27	-	So there are your vector basics, and in thenext video I'll start getting into some pretty
9:31	-	neat
9:32	-	concepts surrounding vectors, like span, bases,and linear dependence.
9:36	-	See you then!
