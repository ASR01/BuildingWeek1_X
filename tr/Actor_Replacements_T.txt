00:00   -    Choosing someone to take over a role from another actor is never easy, especially when
 00:04   -    the original actor drew praise for their take on a character.
 00:07   -    But recasting is often an unavoidable fact of filmmaking, especially for sequels and
 00:11   -    remakes.
 00:12   -    Whether it's creative disagreements, financial setbacks, or simple timing issues at hand,
 00:17   -    actors often become unavailable to resume their roles and must be replaced.
 00:20   -    Sometimes, the newcomer can blend right into the blockbuster scene unnoticed.
 00:24   -    But in the case of these casting switcheroos, the change was just too drastic for audiences
 00:29   -    to endure.
 00:31   -    Clarice Starling
 00:32   -    When Ridley Scott signed on to direct the Silence of the Lambs sequel, he did so without
 00:37   -    his Clarice Starling in place.
 00:39   -    Anthony Hopkins had already negotiated a return to the role of Hannibal Lecter, but Jodie
 00:43   -    Foster didn't share his enthusiasm for the second chapter in the serial killer's story,
 00:48   -    despite winning an Oscar for the role in the first film.
 00:51   -    She later told Total Film, "The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another
 00:56   -    movie, Flora Plum.
 00:57   -    So I get to say, in a nice, dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was
 01:02   -    being shot.
 01:03   -    But Clarice meant so much to [Lambs director Jonathan Demme] and I … there was no way
 01:07   -    that either of us could really trample on her."
 01:10   -    "Now that's really interesting, Clarice.
 01:14   -    I'm really pressed for time."
 01:16   -    Several big name actresses were considered to take her place, and the part ultimately
 01:20   -    went to Julianne Moore.
 01:22   -    While both Scott and Hopkins were happy with the choice, audiences weren't as convinced.
 01:26   -    Moore was inevitably compared to Foster and couldn't measure up to her predecessor's screen
 01:31   -    savvy nor rekindle the creepy connection Clarice had shared with Hopkins in the first film.
 01:36   -    Jodie Foster offered her own diplomatic but shady take on the film, saying, simply, "I
 01:40   -    saw Hannibal.
 01:41   -    I won't comment."
 01:43   -    Evelyn O'Connell
 01:44   -    The Mummy was a surprise smash for Universal, posting global receipts of $415 million and
 01:50   -    landing on the top 10 highest-grossing films of 1999.
 01:54   -    It launched Brendan Fraser's career as a Hollywood action hero and introduced the world to a
 01:58   -    stunning new leading lady in Rachel Weisz.
 02:00   -    The pair made a compelling onscreen couple and reprised their roles in The Mummy Returns,
 02:05   -    which managed to bring in a nice haul from the box office as well.
 02:08   -    But by the time the third film came around, Weisz was suffering from some serious Mummy
 02:13   -    fatigue and stepped aside.
 02:14   -    Weisz was rumored to call the script for the Mummy 3 "crap," so the studio turned to Maria
 02:19   -    Bello to fill in for the role.
 02:21   -    "That should give us a good advantage."
 02:23   -    Unfortunately for Bello, her turn in the role was criticized for lacking the charm of the
 02:27   -    original and the film failed to recoup its production costs in the domestic box office.
 02:31   -    "Hahhahaa, why am I laughing?"
 02:36   -    The Genie
 02:37   -    The '90s marked a moment of resurgence for Disney's animated film collection, with films
 02:41   -    like Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King offering a new generation of children some
 02:45   -    cartoon movies to sing along to.
 02:47   -    One of Disney's most beloved films of the era was Aladdin, an Oscar-winning take on
 02:52   -    the Arabic folk tale about the street thief who shed his rags and won the heart of a princess.
 02:56   -    Aladdin was packed full of great musical numbers, but the main reason it became such a smash
 03:01   -    was the input of the late Robin Williams as the Genie.
 03:04   -    "It's all part and parcel of the Genie gig.
 03:06   -    Phenomenal cosmic power …in an itty bitty living space."
 03:11   -    The actor confirmed that he wouldn't be lending his voice to the direct-to-video sequel The
 03:16   -    Return of Jafar after an alleged row with Disney over its marketing tactics, so the
 03:20   -    search for a new Genie began.
 03:22   -    Dan Castellaneta, the legendary voice of Homer Simpson, was ultimately chosen to voice the
 03:27   -    big blue guy, but the Simpsons star just couldn't measure up to Williams' frenetic performance.
 03:32   -    The quality of the animation didn't help matters, but Castellaneta lacked the unpredictability
 03:37   -    that Williams brought to the Genie, essentially doing a watered-down impression of his predecessor.
 03:42   -    "D'oh!"
 03:44   -    Jack Ryan
 03:45   -    There are five films based on Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan books, but only one actor has played
 03:51   -    the protagonist twice.
 03:52   -    Eyebrows were raised when Alec Baldwin was given the boot after he successfully debuted
 03:56   -    Ryan on-screen in The Hunt for the Red October.
 03:59   -    Baldwin later implied that the studio had gone behind his back and entered into negotiations
 04:03   -    with Ford to take the role of Ryan.
 04:05   -    "Well that was a guess, but it seemed logical."
 04:08   -    Even so, Ford's performance in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger became definitive
 04:13   -    for the character.
 04:14   -    Eight years later, another actor stepped in to bring a much younger version of Jack Ryan
 04:18   -    to the big screen.
 04:19   -    This time, it was Ben Affleck who stepped in for The Sum of All Fears.
 04:23   -    His performance in the role was met with disdain, however, and the Jack Ryan franchise never
 04:27   -    really recovered after that, despite an attempt to reboot it with Chris Pine in the lead more
 04:32   -    than a decade later.
 04:34   -    Sarah Connor
 04:35   -    Following in the footsteps of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor in the Terminator franchise
 04:39   -    was never going to be easy for any actress.
 04:41   -    Hamilton gave a performance so layered and compelling that even the most talented performers
 04:46   -    would have struggled to do the character justice.
 04:48   -    The first to give it a shot was Lena Headey, who was cast in the role in the short-lived
 04:51   -    TV series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.
 04:55   -    Fox cancelled the show after two seasons citing its high cost as a reason, but Headey's Game
 05:00   -    of Thrones colleague Emilia Clarke was willing to give it another go on the silver screen
 05:04   -    for Terminator: Genisys.
 05:06   -    The film was a box office dud and was heavily criticized for using the old time travel chestnut
 05:12   -    to rewrite the beginning of the Terminator story to suit the filmmakers' purposes.
 05:15   -    The main problem wasn't the infuriatingly muddled timeline, though.
 05:20   -    It was the casting.
 05:21   -    As much as TV lovers might dig Clarke's portrayal of Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones,
 05:27   -    the film crowd was decidedly not wowed by her run as Sarah Connor, where her line deliveries
 05:32   -    packed a lot less punch than the original.
 05:34   -    "Come with me if you want to live."
 05:36   -    Pass.
 05:38   -    Van Wilder
 05:39   -    National Lampoon's Van Wilder isn't going to be preserved in the Library of Congress
 05:44   -    National Film Registry anytime soon.
 05:46   -    Yet for all its failings, fans of a certain age remember this movie fondly.
 05:50   -    This was a time when frat humor was at its peak, and sitting down to watch a comedy usually
 05:55   -    meant turning your brain off for 90 minutes.
 05:58   -    Van Wilder might not have been the most cerebral comedy of all time, but Ryan Reynolds still
 06:02   -    delivered as the fast-talking cool guy who threw the best parties and was a softie underneath
 06:07   -    all those crazy antics.
 06:09   -    After the Kal Penn-led sequel was destroyed by critics, the producers decided their next
 06:14   -    move would be a prequel featuring a younger version of Van Wilder.
 06:17   -    Reynolds refused to return to the role, so they brought in Mean Girls' Jonathan Bennett
 06:20   -    for Van Wilder: Freshman Year — which was a terrible mistake.
 06:24   -    "I have never seen such a sorry display in all my life."
 06:28   -    The actor couldn't come close to the charisma of his predecessor and produced a feature-length
 06:33   -    failed impression effort as a result.
 06:35   -    Willie Mays Hayes
 06:37   -    Major League was a surprise grand slam for Paramount Pictures and produced two increasingly
 06:42   -    terrible sequels.
 06:43   -    And while Charlie Sheen's Wild Thing came back for a second round at the mound in Major
 06:47   -    League II, there was another standout actor from the first film who refused to run the
 06:51   -    bases of this franchise again.
 06:53   -    Wesley Snipes, whose charming swagger as the speedy base thief was a homerun in the first
 06:58   -    movie, had no interest in returning to the dugout for the second movie.
 07:01   -    At the time, he was well on his way to becoming a Hollywood MVP in his own right, thanks to
 07:06   -    movies like White Men Can't Jump and Demolition Man, so he pretty much priced himself out
 07:10   -    of the second movie.
 07:11   -    With the Cleveland Indians down a man on the roster, the filmmakers turned to relative
 07:15   -    newcomer Omar Epps to sub in as pinch runner for the project.
 07:19   -    Unfortunately, Epps didn't have a strong background in comedy and his performance was the cinematic
 07:24   -    equivalent of a foul ball.
 07:26   -    "Read some of your reviews man.
 07:27   -    One guy said Willie Mays Hayes couldn't play dead."
 07:29   -    Just a bit outside...
 07:31   -    Albus Dumbledore
 07:33   -    The Prisoner of Azkaban might still be a favorite among some Harry Potter fans, thanks to the
 07:39   -    arrival of Sirius Black and that wild whomping willow.
 07:42   -    But the fact remains that it's the lowest grossing movie in the franchise, and for many,
 07:47   -    the subdued enthusiasm seems to stem from the unfortunate arrival of a new Hogwarts
 07:52   -    headmaster in the film.
 07:53   -    Richard Harris' take on Albus Dumbledore in the first two movies had become definitive
 07:57   -    for Potter fans.
 07:58   -    So when the actor died after a battle with Hodgkin's disease, the filmmakers had to turn
 08:03   -    to another actor to step into the beloved professor's cloak.
 08:06   -    Michael Gambon seemed like a fine choice to conjure up for the franchise, but his performance
 08:10   -    in his first run as Dumbledore was stunted by the fact that he never read the books.
 08:15   -    Rather than resuming Harris' spellbindingly calm and wise demeanor, Gambon delivered a
 08:20   -    much more stern and aggressive version of the character for his first few outings.
 08:25   -    "Harry!
 08:25   -    Did you put your name in that Goblet of Fire?"
 08:27   -    "No sir!"
 08:28   -    "Did you ask one of the older students to do it?
 08:30   -    "No sir."
 08:31   -    "Are you absolutely sure?
 08:32   -    "Yes sir."
 08:33   -    Gambon would later summon up some sort of chill pill that saved the role from being
 08:37   -    ruined for children across the globe, but these moments of mismatching between the beloved
 08:42   -    book character and the screen interpretation still cost the movies many house points in
 08:46   -    the eyes of the true Potter fanatics.
 08:49   -    Catwoman
 08:51   -    Halle Berry taking over Michelle Pfeiffer's role in Catwoman is perhaps the most infamous
 08:55   -    example of recasting going terribly wrong.
 08:58   -    DC's leather-clad heroine has appeared in numerous Batman adaptations over the years,
 09:02   -    but Pfeiffer's psychotically sexy performance in Tim Burton's Batman Returns remains the
 09:07   -    cat's meow.
 09:08   -    "I don't know about you Miss Kitty but I feel so much yummier."
 09:14   -    The actress initially intended to reprise the role in the solo spinoff.
 09:18   -    But after years of development woes, her patience reached its limit and she decided to concentrate
 09:23   -    on other commitments.
 09:24   -    After a rigorous recruiting process, Berry was ultimately chosen to climb into the catsuit
 09:29   -    — and what a mess it all was.
 09:31   -    The film was a complete disaster, bombing hard at the box office while cleaning up at
 09:36   -    the Razzies.
 09:36   -    Berry took her Worst Actress win in good humor and even turned up to accept her award in
 09:41   -    person.
 09:42   -    Batman
 09:44   -    Another error of judgment from the Batman universe occurred when Michael Keaton handed
 09:48   -    over the keys for Wayne Manor to Val Kilmer.
 09:51   -    Keaton had portrayed the role in 1989's Batman and its sequel Batman Returns, but he refused
 09:56   -    to reprise the role in a third film after reading the screenplay.
 09:59   -    When pressed for details, Keaton later said that the script he was shown "sucked" and
 10:03   -    that "it was just awful," pointing the blame for his departure squarely at the writers.
 10:07   -    Val Kilmer clearly didn't share Keaton's opinion.
 10:10   -    The Tombstone star accepted the role and went into the film knowing he'd have to contend
 10:14   -    with a wide cast of wacky villains as well as a new director.
 10:18   -    Joel Schumacher ultimately shouldered a lot of the blame for the badness of Batman Forever,
 10:22   -    though his leading man didn't escape criticism.
 10:25   -    "What am I?"
 10:28   -    "Please, you're as blind as a bat."
 10:32   -    He was quickly replaced with George Clooney in Batman & Robin.
 10:36   -    The good news for Kilmer was that Clooney's turn as the The Dark Knight wasn't any more
 10:40   -    loved than his own, and soon everyone forgot about Kilmer's turn in the batmobile.
 10:44   -    "Forget it, take it off"
 10:48   -    "It's Val Kilmer!"
 10:51   -    "Oh.
 10:51   -    You're an actor?"
