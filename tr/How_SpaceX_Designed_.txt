 00:04   -    hello it's scott manley here and
 00:06   -    this week at spacex can truly be
 00:08   -    described with the word awesome
 00:10   -    and i'm not just using that in the sort
 00:12   -    of lame american way i'm talking about
 00:15   -    the literally filled with awe looking at
 00:18   -    the monstrous
 00:19   -    construction of starship and super heavy
 00:22   -    you many people are skeptical as to
 00:24   -    whether this thing can truly deliver
 00:26   -    what it works but
 00:27   -    it has they have stacked it for at least
 00:30   -    an hour
 00:31   -    and it is taller than the saturn v
 00:34   -    it is an absolute monster of a vehicle
 00:37   -    and yeah this was something that
 00:40   -    happened just in the last week they
 00:42   -    finished out the vehicles as much was
 00:44   -    as was necessary so they could be rolled
 00:45   -    to the pad and perform this
 00:47   -    fit check they have a landing structure
 00:50   -    or sorry a
 00:51   -    launch structure which consists of this
 00:53   -    large ring
 00:54   -    with like removable arms that come down
 00:57   -    to support
 00:58   -    the bottom of the vehicle um and they
 01:00   -    fold out
 01:01   -    fold back up during launch the the
 01:04   -    booster itself
 01:05   -    it rolled out with 29 engines on and
 01:08   -    it seemed that they fitted these engines
 01:10   -    overnight although
 01:11   -    it's clear that they weren't truly
 01:13   -    integrated into the vehicle because
 01:15   -    they're
 01:15   -    being taken back off now one of the
 01:18   -    things that we saw
 01:19   -    is a photograph from elon showing the
 01:21   -    booster from below
 01:23   -    and you could see that some of the
 01:24   -    engines had white interiors in their
 01:27   -    nozzles
 01:27   -    showing that they had never been
 01:29   -    test-fired now i think in theory
 01:31   -    they can do things where they swap out
 01:33   -    nozzles but
 01:34   -    i think they basically rolled the or
 01:37   -    moved the booster engines
 01:38   -    straight to boca chica put them on the
 01:41   -    booster and now they'll be taking them
 01:42   -    off and sending them off to mcgregor for
 01:44   -    actual testing and validation
 01:47   -    the booster also has four grid fins and
 01:50   -    this is the first time we've seen this
 01:52   -    on
 01:52   -    a super heavy launch vehicle
 01:55   -    now the falcon 9 has grid fins as well
 01:58   -    has four of them
 01:59   -    and they're arranged at 90 degree angles
 02:01   -    around each other and that allows them
 02:02   -    to
 02:03   -    guide the vehicle aerodynamically to its
 02:05   -    landing site
 02:07   -    but on super heavy they've made a few
 02:09   -    changes first of all these are
 02:11   -    monster like three ton stainless steel
 02:14   -    grid fins they're
 02:15   -    absolutely humongous
 02:18   -    secondly unlike the falcon 9 these ones
 02:21   -    do not fold in
 02:22   -    on a cent they're fixed all the way out
 02:24   -    they still roll left and right
 02:26   -    and on falcon 9 they're driven by
 02:27   -    hydraulics on
 02:29   -    super heavy they're currently driven by
 02:31   -    motors and batteries from tesla vehicles
 02:34   -    which obviously makes sense um
 02:38   -    the other thing is that they're not at
 02:39   -    90 degrees to each other they're in
 02:41   -    pairs
 02:42   -    60 degree apart opposite each other and
 02:45   -    that has the effect of giving them more
 02:47   -    control authority in one axis at the
 02:49   -    expense of control authority in another
 02:51   -    axis
 02:51   -    and the thing is during the descent
 02:54   -    it's maintaining this sort of glides
 02:57   -    angle
 02:58   -    as it's you're trying to head towards
 02:59   -    the target so it needs more control
 03:02   -    in that axis and less control at uh your
 03:05   -    yawing or rolling so
 03:07   -    i can see why they've done this and it
 03:09   -    makes sense
 03:10   -    but what i really want to talk about is
 03:13   -    the starship
 03:14   -    so this is starship number 20. a booster
 03:16   -    4 starship 20
 03:18   -    420 gold figure
 03:22   -    again it's the first starship where
 03:23   -    we've seen the three
 03:25   -    fixed uh vacuum engines on there and
 03:28   -    again some of those
 03:29   -    engines that we saw from below have
 03:32   -    white interiors
 03:33   -    indicating they haven't been test-fired
 03:35   -    they've already been taken off and i
 03:37   -    believe they're going to get fired soon
 03:39   -    more interestingly
 03:41   -    we got a really good look at a
 03:43   -    near-complete
 03:44   -    thermal protection system so the thermal
 03:46   -    protection system
 03:47   -    on starship is absolutely critical to
 03:50   -    starship
 03:51   -    doing what it plans starship wants to be
 03:54   -    a rapidly
 03:55   -    reusable system and it needs a thermal
 03:57   -    protection system
 03:59   -    which needs almost no maintenance so
 04:01   -    spacex have already developed a working
 04:04   -    heat shield for their dragon spacecraft
 04:06   -    but it is a different beast entirely the
 04:09   -    dragon capsule
 04:10   -    it returns from space lands in the water
 04:12   -    and then goes off to a factory to be
 04:15   -    refurbished and the heat shield replaced
 04:17   -    because they're replacing the heat
 04:19   -    shield
 04:19   -    they use an ablative heat shield they
 04:21   -    use something called
 04:22   -    pica x phenolic impregnated carbon
 04:26   -    ablator
 04:27   -    and the ablator part what it is is
 04:29   -    there's a
 04:30   -    the resin the phenolic resin that makes
 04:32   -    up this heat shield
 04:33   -    when it gets hot due to the re-entry
 04:35   -    heating it breaks down and creates gas
 04:38   -    and that gas
 04:39   -    comes out through the surface and it
 04:40   -    provides a protective layer
 04:42   -    and because of this they can get away
 04:44   -    with a much thinner and lighter heat
 04:46   -    shield
 04:47   -    now starship on the other hand is
 04:49   -    supposed to be rapidly reusable that is
 04:51   -    the dream that this thing can
 04:52   -    land it can have a quick inspection and
 04:54   -    be put back on top of the launch vehicle
 04:57   -    and
 04:57   -    head straight back to space and that
 05:00   -    means
 05:00   -    you can't afford to replace the entire
 05:02   -    heat shield every time so you need to
 05:04   -    use
 05:05   -    an insulating type heat shield that can
 05:07   -    handle the very high temperatures
 05:08   -    without breaking down and the closest
 05:11   -    thing we've seen to that is the space
 05:12   -    shuttle and the space shuttle
 05:14   -    had a pretty bad reputation for its heat
 05:16   -    shield like it was
 05:18   -    eternally a problem and indeed they
 05:20   -    almost they lost
 05:21   -    one vehicle because the heat shield was
 05:24   -    damaged and they almost
 05:25   -    lost at least a couple of others the
 05:28   -    heat shield needed
 05:29   -    a lot of inspection and replacement
 05:31   -    between flights
 05:33   -    so since the space shuttle had such
 05:35   -    problems how do we think
 05:36   -    that spacex can do the same thing with
 05:39   -    starship
 05:40   -    but get rid of all the problems well
 05:42   -    first of all there's a few things that
 05:44   -    are on spacex's side first of all the
 05:47   -    space shuttle was mounted on site
 05:49   -    side on to a tank and that tank had
 05:52   -    flecks of
 05:53   -    foam and ice and those would fall off
 05:56   -    and impinge on the bottom surface which
 05:57   -    is where your heat shield is
 05:59   -    like in retrospect it would have made
 06:01   -    more sense to mount the space shuttle
 06:03   -    upside down on the tank so
 06:05   -    the top of the shuttle would be getting
 06:06   -    damaged by this stuff but you know
 06:09   -    these are the kind of things you learn
 06:10   -    after you've flown for a while
 06:13   -    spacex don't have this problem with
 06:14   -    starship because starship sits on top
 06:17   -    the other thing is the space shuttle had
 06:19   -    a very complex geometry and the complex
 06:22   -    geometry
 06:23   -    meant that it needed lots of different
 06:25   -    tile designs to cover
 06:27   -    the entirety of the vehicle they had if
 06:30   -    they had a
 06:31   -    tile that needed replaced they had to go
 06:33   -    and get that exact
 06:34   -    tile from the thousands of different
 06:36   -    designs and make sure it was inserted in
 06:38   -    there
 06:39   -    um there's other problems that the space
 06:41   -    shuttle had that
 06:43   -    used aluminium which had greater
 06:45   -    expansion
 06:46   -    than uh the stainless steel that we'll
 06:48   -    be seeing on starship
 06:50   -    um but yeah the the and the other thing
 06:53   -    is that starship
 06:54   -    can afford to get warmer underneath or
 06:56   -    hotter because it's stainless steel
 06:58   -    whereas
 06:59   -    the shuttle had an aluminium structure
 07:02   -    underneath
 07:03   -    so starship's much simpler geometry
 07:05   -    means that the majority of the tiles
 07:07   -    are these identical hexagonal designs
 07:11   -    and
 07:11   -    you know to get an idea of how big these
 07:13   -    things are they're about the size of
 07:14   -    dinner plates i think they're about you
 07:16   -    know 12 inches 30 centimeters across
 07:19   -    and they are very easy to apply to the
 07:22   -    side of the
 07:23   -    the structure so you're not going in
 07:26   -    and applying strain isolation pads and
 07:29   -    then
 07:30   -    glue and then spacers and then supports
 07:33   -    and then the tile
 07:35   -    you're literally going up and there's
 07:37   -    mounting pins that have been pre-placed
 07:39   -    on there there's a robot
 07:40   -    that goes in and welds on these mounting
 07:42   -    pins with little uh
 07:44   -    spring clips in their head and you
 07:46   -    basically just
 07:47   -    push the tile on and there are little
 07:49   -    holes
 07:50   -    in the tile with metal brackets inside
 07:53   -    them
 07:54   -    and these will clip on and one of the
 07:56   -    nice things is that
 07:58   -    when it's mounted there's actually some
 07:59   -    play in these holes
 08:01   -    and because they use three of them the
 08:03   -    tile can actually respond as the
 08:05   -    structure moves underneath it so it's
 08:06   -    not
 08:07   -    like uh the space shuttle where they had
 08:09   -    to have these fabric
 08:11   -    isolation pads to you know stop the
 08:14   -    flexing from popping the tile off it's
 08:16   -    really it has a lot of freedom to move
 08:20   -    there is actually a pad underneath which
 08:23   -    we believe
 08:24   -    is some kind of ceramic wool design it's
 08:26   -    probably made of silica
 08:27   -    or alumina fibers it'll probably handle
 08:31   -    your temperatures of a thousand degrees
 08:32   -    celsius quite easily
 08:35   -    but it's not like a primary heat shield
 08:38   -    by any means if you lose a tile
 08:40   -    i wouldn't rely on this to give you a
 08:42   -    significant amount of protection
 08:45   -    so anyway yeah a lot of the tiles just
 08:46   -    pop on like that the biggest thing is
 08:48   -    that you have to
 08:50   -    make sure that they're closed as close
 08:52   -    together as possible
 08:54   -    so that you minimize the amount of heat
 08:55   -    coming through these gaps
 08:57   -    but not so close that when the vehicle
 09:00   -    is in motion that they start
 09:01   -    banging together and potentially
 09:02   -    breaking
 09:04   -    so there are areas where they need to
 09:07   -    have
 09:08   -    you know slightly irregular patterns
 09:10   -    first of all the nose cone
 09:12   -    that is a complex structure because it
 09:14   -    curves and tapers towards a point
 09:17   -    so they have a bunch of different
 09:18   -    strategies for slowly shrinking these
 09:20   -    rings as they go up
 09:22   -    the wings or sorry the fins those have a
 09:26   -    whole bunch of very specific shapes on
 09:28   -    them and they're being filled in right
 09:30   -    now
 09:31   -    now only half of starship is being tiled
 09:34   -    the back end is only going to get plasma
 09:37   -    from the
 09:38   -    your trail it's going to get like
 09:40   -    reflected heat from the radiate the
 09:41   -    thermal radiation
 09:43   -    so the stainless steel is actually quite
 09:46   -    good at reflecting that
 09:47   -    and that's what we'll use now on the
 09:48   -    space shuttle you'll notice that the
 09:50   -    bottom off
 09:51   -    is black because they wanted it to
 09:53   -    radiate heat efficiently
 09:55   -    the top of it is white because most of
 09:57   -    the heat was coming in by thermal
 09:58   -    radiation
 09:59   -    and so they wanted it to reflect as much
 10:01   -    of that as possible that's why the
 10:03   -    bottom of the shuttle is black
 10:05   -    and the same is true on starship the
 10:06   -    bottom is going to be black because
 10:08   -    it's going to be re you re-emitting
 10:11   -    as much thermal radiation as possible
 10:13   -    and the top is going to be reflecting
 10:16   -    so anyway the majority of the tiles are
 10:18   -    added via this pin method
 10:20   -    and it's interesting to note that once
 10:22   -    they're attached they can't be removed
 10:25   -    from the other side we've seen them
 10:26   -    taking them off and they have to go in
 10:28   -    with a drill
 10:29   -    and use like a coring drill bit to get
 10:32   -    access to the clips
 10:33   -    so they can then pull them off and
 10:35   -    replace them with new ones
 10:36   -    now near the front we've also seen that
 10:39   -    they're not using pin mounts they're
 10:41   -    essentially gluing these things straight
 10:43   -    down it looks like the glue is red so
 10:44   -    that's consistent with what they used on
 10:46   -    the shuttle
 10:47   -    so there's that on the nose cone the
 10:50   -    other place where they
 10:51   -    are doing direct gluing appears to be
 10:53   -    along
 10:54   -    the the interface on the top
 10:58   -    on the wings so the fins have this hinge
 11:01   -    mechanism
 11:01   -    where they need to be able to rotate and
 11:03   -    you don't want to have a gap in there so
 11:05   -    there's a cylindrical
 11:06   -    shape here which has a bunch of tiles in
 11:09   -    it and
 11:09   -    they're going to have to have all sorts
 11:10   -    of seals here to try and make sure
 11:12   -    that the hot gas doesn't flow in there
 11:15   -    and potentially damage anything
 11:16   -    any of the actuators there is like
 11:20   -    mounting hinges at the top that's going
 11:21   -    to be a difficult one and elon has
 11:23   -    actually talked about using
 11:25   -    transpiration cooling the original plan
 11:28   -    when the announced starship was becoming
 11:30   -    stainless steel was
 11:31   -    they originally talked about
 11:33   -    transpiration cooling and that's where
 11:35   -    you try to get the
 11:36   -    insulating effect that the ablator has
 11:40   -    but instead of having a chemical
 11:41   -    breakdown you literally take your
 11:43   -    methane fuel supply or your oxygen it's
 11:45   -    methane probably
 11:46   -    blow that through tiny pores in the skin
 11:49   -    and it forms an insulating layer and
 11:50   -    protects you
 11:51   -    i think that was dropped because it's
 11:54   -    much more complex and it may actually
 11:56   -    take more mass to do this but there are
 11:58   -    places where it could be useful
 11:59   -    it could definitely be useful where
 12:01   -    you've got moving parts near these
 12:04   -    hinges
 12:04   -    and you can blow in high pressure fuel
 12:07   -    and just protect the protect these from
 12:11   -    high temperature plasma going in
 12:13   -    now there's one other thing that helps
 12:15   -    starship compared to say the space
 12:17   -    shuttle or the x-37
 12:19   -    which are reusable vehicles with
 12:21   -    reusable heat shields
 12:23   -    and that is the fact that starship is
 12:24   -    just so darn
 12:26   -    big so there's a basic factor
 12:30   -    in reentry aerodynamics called
 12:33   -    the the radius of curvature so blunt
 12:36   -    bodies are the way to go for re-entry
 12:38   -    because
 12:39   -    the blunter your body right the
 12:42   -    clutter the further away the stagnation
 12:45   -    point is and the stagnation point is
 12:46   -    basically where you've got this
 12:48   -    shock wave that is formed just in front
 12:50   -    of the body in the layer
 12:52   -    the speed of the incoming air has gone
 12:54   -    from like hypersonic speeds
 12:55   -    down to basically the speed of the
 12:57   -    vehicle and it forms the shock wave at
 12:59   -    some distance from the surface and
 13:00   -    that's where most of your heat is
 13:02   -    so you want that to be as far away from
 13:04   -    the surface as possible
 13:06   -    and the bigger your radius of curvature
 13:08   -    the further away
 13:10   -    your stagnation point uh your shock wave
 13:12   -    gets
 13:13   -    so by having starship be so large
 13:16   -    this really helps it a whole lot
 13:19   -    compared to something like
 13:20   -    very small like the x37b which is
 13:22   -    absolutely tiny
 13:25   -    but you know starship isn't just a
 13:26   -    simple cylinder it has other complex
 13:29   -    geometry and when you have
 13:30   -    changes to the shape this can do all
 13:32   -    sorts of interesting things
 13:34   -    in terms of generating shock waves
 13:36   -    generating hot spots and
 13:38   -    they will have done a lot of simulations
 13:41   -    to make sure they have the right amount
 13:43   -    of thermal protection system
 13:45   -    where they expect these spots to be they
 13:47   -    will do simulations
 13:48   -    in hypersonic wind tunnels they will do
 13:51   -    like computational fluid dynamics to try
 13:54   -    to understand
 13:55   -    before they fly this but flight will be
 13:58   -    the ultimate test and there's a lot of
 14:00   -    things that could go wrong
 14:01   -    i mean first of all you know if there's
 14:03   -    any damage to the heat shield at all
 14:04   -    they could lose the entire vehicle
 14:06   -    during descent and they would like to
 14:08   -    know how one way is to have
 14:10   -    instrumentation like thermocouples
 14:12   -    across the surface to measure
 14:13   -    the temperature in different locations
 14:15   -    they could actually have cameras like
 14:16   -    inside the tanks looking at the inside
 14:19   -    surface because
 14:20   -    literally the outer wall of the tanks is
 14:23   -    the surface of the vehicle so that could
 14:24   -    actually give them some clues
 14:26   -    but you know in terms of damage i think
 14:29   -    it's actually more likely to get damaged
 14:31   -    on
 14:32   -    ascent because max q typically is the
 14:35   -    highest
 14:35   -    dynamic pressures that a vehicle will
 14:37   -    see that was true the space shuttle
 14:39   -    like it was more likely to it was
 14:41   -    getting higher like aerodynamic
 14:43   -    pressures
 14:43   -    on ascent than they did during descent
 14:45   -    because
 14:46   -    if you think about it they were flying
 14:48   -    this sort of like an aerodynamic vehicle
 14:51   -    and if they fall down lower your dynamic
 14:52   -    pressures the force of the atmosphere
 14:54   -    gets higher
 14:55   -    but since you can use the lift you can
 14:57   -    avoid that happening and keep the
 14:59   -    pressures at a low
 15:01   -    manageable level so yeah if there's
 15:04   -    going to get damaged
 15:06   -    most likely to happen during on ascent
 15:08   -    where we might see it
 15:09   -    rather than descent where we
 15:12   -    might not see it i mean you know if i
 15:14   -    was like an engineer on this project
 15:17   -    i would uh i would build a cubesat right
 15:20   -    that would pop
 15:20   -    out of the rear out of the skirt fly
 15:23   -    backwards with a camera on it and then
 15:24   -    have the
 15:25   -    starship do a roll around so we could
 15:27   -    actually observe
 15:28   -    tile damage before descent i think that
 15:31   -    would be a cool idea right
 15:33   -    but you know that's uh i think that
 15:35   -    would probably take them time to develop
 15:37   -    but it would be interesting
 15:38   -    nevertheless and you know this is
 15:40   -    something that was talked about with the
 15:42   -    space shuttle during the early launches
 15:43   -    they apparently wanted to use
 15:46   -    um us photo reconnaissance
 15:49   -    satellites to actually observe the heat
 15:51   -    shield on the space shuttle
 15:53   -    and there supposedly they delayed the
 15:56   -    launch or had to
 15:57   -    match the shuttle's launch window to the
 16:00   -    capabilities of this satellite
 16:02   -    um it would be cool if they would do
 16:05   -    that with starship but you know
 16:06   -    everything is in flux everything
 16:08   -    is moving obviously spacex are running
 16:11   -    very hard towards getting this vehicle
 16:13   -    launched
 16:14   -    but the thing that is going to limit
 16:16   -    them most likely
 16:18   -    is getting the faa to complete its
 16:20   -    environmental review because they need
 16:22   -    to make sure that the site
 16:24   -    is compliant they've gone and scaled it
 16:26   -    up from an initial plan to launch falcon
 16:28   -    rockets
 16:29   -    to now launching big falcon rockets
 16:34   -    right or starship so anyway yeah it's
 16:37   -    been a marvelous week
 16:38   -    there's been so many amazing photos that
 16:41   -    have come out of this
 16:42   -    and i have i've just been glued to all
 16:44   -    of these i
 16:45   -    i really once again thanks to everybody
 16:47   -    down there
 16:48   -    that is are getting these amazing photos
 16:50   -    and also you know everyday astronaut
 16:52   -    apparently he's just published like part
 16:55   -    one of a three-part interview with elon
 16:58   -    and uh elon just talking talking talking
 17:02   -    and
 17:02   -    telling us all sorts of fascinating
 17:04   -    little things and the problem is
 17:05   -    sometimes he'll say
 17:07   -    you know tim will say something and elon
 17:10   -    will start thinking it over in his head
 17:12   -    and saying oh maybe we shouldn't do that
 17:13   -    oh no we can't do it
 17:14   -    like it's almost like he's he's
 17:17   -    designing
 17:18   -    ideas in his head like yeah elon's not
 17:21   -    always the best person to
 17:23   -    do presentations but the fact that he's
 17:25   -    just talking
 17:28   -    actually lends this uh a great wonderful
 17:31   -    authenticity it's quite enjoyable
 17:34   -    and i wish them the best of luck with
 17:35   -    this whenever it happens
 17:37   -    i'm scott manley fly safe
 17:47   -    [Music]
 17:59   -    you
