Description:	Hasselblad cameras have taken some of the most iconic photos of the 20th century. From the first moon landing, to The Beatles crossing Abbey Road, and portraits of Marilyn Monroe. But the company has gained a reputation for having extremely expensive cameras. Hasselblad’s H6D-100c camera costs over $30,000. But its cameras weren’t always this expensive.

Editor’s Note: The lens shown at 1:24 is designed for the X System cameras, not the H System as shown.

 0.799	-	do you recognize this photo
3.28	-	what about these they were all taken
6.56	-	with a hasselblad camera it's a name
9.28	-	every photographer knows
11.44	-	but if you wanted to buy this hasselblad
13.759	-	camera
14.559	-	you'd need over thirty thousand dollars
17.039	-	and that doesn't even include the lens
19.84	-	so why would anyone pay so much for a
22.16	-	camera
23.6	-	and what makes hasselblad's so expensive
28.16	-	to understand why people love hasselblad
30.24	-	cameras it helps to look at this image
33.44	-	if you zoom way in you can see
35.36	-	incredible detail
37.12	-	the photos are fantastic but it's a
39.44	-	little more complicated than that
42.16	-	hasselblad has been making cameras for
43.92	-	80 years but they weren't always this
46.559	-	expensive in 1948 hasselblad's first
49.84	-	consumer camera cost around 500
52.559	-	or about 5900 today
55.6	-	and adjusted for inflation its film
58.0	-	cameras from the 70s cost around 5 300
61.6	-	but when the company transitioned to
63.199	-	digital the price exploded
66.0	-	in 2004 hasselblad's first digital
68.56	-	camera
69.04	-	sold for around 24 000.
72.08	-	that was more than a two hundred percent
74.08	-	price increase from its previous model
76.08	-	which used film
78.24	-	okay so it's expensive but what actually
80.88	-	makes
81.36	-	this camera different hasselblad's
84.799	-	high-end cameras consist of three main
87.119	-	parts
88.24	-	the digital back the body and the lens
91.2	-	just the digital back
92.479	-	which includes the sensor costs over 26
95.119	-	thousand dollars
96.72	-	the hasselblad sensor is unique in the
99.36	-	way that
100.079	-	it's much larger in an area the
103.04	-	individual
103.92	-	pixel is bigger and that provides
106.96	-	a lower noise and wider dynamic range
110.64	-	take a look at this photo of a
111.84	-	motorcycle when you zoom in you can
114.32	-	clearly see the texture of the handle
116.56	-	and the wear on its tires larger sensors
119.92	-	capture more detail
121.2	-	and hasselblads is one of the biggest
123.2	-	available
124.479	-	its cameras are what's called medium
126.079	-	format basically it means the sensor is
129.2	-	big and it's what makes these cameras so
131.52	-	expensive
132.64	-	your smartphone camera sensor is around
134.879	-	this big
136.08	-	a popular professional camera like the
138.16	-	sony a7r
139.44	-	is much larger but it looks tiny
142.4	-	compared to hasselblad sensor
144.72	-	when medium format technology
147.12	-	transitioned from
148.16	-	analog to digital the media format
151.68	-	sensors
152.4	-	became extremely expensive and the
154.879	-	camera systems became
156.0	-	extremely expensive and very niche
159.2	-	the sensor in this camera is actually
161.28	-	made by sony
162.879	-	but hasselblad has its own proprietary
165.12	-	calibration process
166.4	-	to achieve the colors and image quality
168.64	-	it wants
170.08	-	it's very useful for the skin tones or
173.12	-	the reproduction of the artwork and so
175.12	-	on where you really
176.72	-	need to make sure that the colors you
179.04	-	have in real life
180.159	-	are the ones that will end up later in
182.319	-	the photographs medium format cameras
185.04	-	are mainly used for product
186.64	-	and fashion photography as well as art
188.879	-	reproduction
190.4	-	photographers who need this type of
191.84	-	specialized technology can't use
193.76	-	off-the-shelf consumer cameras
195.84	-	and these shoots usually take place in a
197.76	-	studio where the camera's bulky size
199.92	-	isn't an issue but there's another
202.319	-	factor that makes hasselblad cameras
204.08	-	unique
205.2	-	unlike other companies hasselblad
207.04	-	doesn't mass produce its cameras
209.28	-	it makes them in small batches assembled
211.599	-	by hand
213.04	-	this is partly because hasselblad
214.799	-	doesn't make that many cameras
217.12	-	hasselblad doesn't disclose exactly how
219.28	-	many cameras it makes
220.799	-	but in 2018 the verge reported that
223.2	-	hasselblad's yearly production was under
225.28	-	10
225.599	-	000 units other manufacturers like canon
229.2	-	produce millions of cameras each year
232.159	-	but this process also ensures that each
234.4	-	camera meets hasselblad's quality
236.08	-	standards
237.36	-	here in production we have people that
238.959	-	works here for over 30 years
241.519	-	and for special tasks we have people
245.36	-	that
245.68	-	they just do that task nobody else can
247.519	-	do that
250.239	-	hasselblad assembles its cameras here in
252.64	-	gothenburg sweden
254.4	-	remember this old photo production today
257.28	-	looks pretty similar
259.199	-	its facility is more like a lab than an
261.44	-	assembly line
263.04	-	here each component is tested connected
265.44	-	and soldered
267.44	-	but learning how to adjust each part
269.199	-	isn't easy
272.24	-	assemblers rely on both precise
274.08	-	instruments and the sound and feel of
276.32	-	each component
277.36	-	to know that it's working properly my
280.32	-	favorite part is the
282.639	-	mirror assembly this part
287.36	-	i know that's not working well because
289.04	-	of the click you have to work here maybe
291.12	-	in in just assembling this part maybe
293.44	-	months
294.88	-	actually are capable of making it right
298.08	-	when you charge thirty thousand dollars
299.52	-	for a camera quality control is a top
301.84	-	priority
302.88	-	and assemblers take their job very
304.72	-	seriously
306.4	-	the whole process requires a lot of
307.84	-	patience you will end up learning to be
310.24	-	very careful while mounting these tiny
311.919	-	parts
312.479	-	otherwise you will run into different
314.24	-	issues afterwards while testing the
316.08	-	camera
317.68	-	assemblers complete a camera in around
319.68	-	six to eight hours
321.199	-	the calibration can take up to a third
323.44	-	of that time
325.199	-	what's unique about hasselblad cameras
328.0	-	is that
328.56	-	each sensor is individually calibrated
332.16	-	and tested
333.44	-	to a single pixel level which is very
336.24	-	time consuming and quite
338.0	-	unlike in this industry but pressure to
341.36	-	deliver consumer-focused cameras has
343.44	-	increased
344.96	-	in the past few years hasselblad has
346.96	-	released more affordable cameras
348.8	-	around six thousand dollars these
351.039	-	cameras have a smaller sensor compared
352.88	-	to other more expensive models
355.199	-	the competition in this price range is
357.28	-	steep
358.319	-	sony's latest alpha one camera costs a
360.479	-	bit more but it can shoot 8k
362.24	-	video and has super fast autofocus
365.36	-	and while the sensors on cheaper cameras
367.199	-	aren't as large
368.479	-	those cameras pack more features that
370.08	-	appeal to a wide range of photographers
373.039	-	hasselblad says that it's working to
374.72	-	introduce more entry-level
376.319	-	medium format cameras but that it will
378.56	-	continue to support its high-end
380.08	-	customers
382.0	-	and for many photographers who need
383.84	-	uncompromising image quality
385.919	-	this hasselblad continues to be worth
387.919	-	the price
