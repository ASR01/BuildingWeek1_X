Description:	The Maxwell's Equations are four coupled differential equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. Carl Sagan once said, "Maxwell's equations have done more good to mankind than any 10 Presidents combined". This quote shows how important the Maxwell's equations really are. Maxwell himself did not come up with these equations. He combined these 4 equations to prove that light is an electromagnetic wave. In order to understand Maxwell's equations, we must know what is divergence and curl.

1. Gauss' law in electricity: The Gauss' law in electricity states that the the divergence of electric field is directly proportional to the charge density. This law says that isolated positive or negative charges are responsible for electric fields.

2. Gauss' law in magnetism: The Gauss' law in magnetism states that the divergence of magnetic field is zero. This means that magnetic monopoles cannot exist.

3. Faraday's law: One of the most important equations in history, the Faraday's law states that a time varying magnetic field can produce an electric field. 

4. Ampere's law: The Ampere's law gives a relation between the curl of the magnetic field and the current density. There was a theoretical and experimental flaw in Ampere's law. Maxwell corrected Ampere's law by adding another term to it.

 0:0	-	hello my name is rishabh and welcome to
0:3	-	the channel the secrets of the universe
0:4	-	today we are going to talk about the
0:7	-	Maxwell's equations before I start I
0:10	-	want to quote the famous astronomer
0:12	-	Calphalon he said that Maxwell's
0:15	-	equations have done more good to mankind
0:17	-	than any ten presidents combined now
0:20	-	this line this code from Carl Sagan
0:22	-	holds a lot of importance it really
0:25	-	tells how important these equations are
0:27	-	now one thing to be noted is that
0:30	-	Maxwell did not come up with these
0:32	-	equations he himself did not devise all
0:35	-	of them
0:35	-	he just combined these four equations
0:37	-	and proved that light is actually an
0:40	-	electromagnetic wave Maxwell's equations
0:44	-	are the backbone of the classical
0:46	-	electromagnetism classical optics and
0:49	-	modern electronics now before we start
0:53	-	it is very important to know what is the
0:56	-	physical meaning of the Maxwell's
0:57	-	equations for that we need to understand
1:0	-	what is the meaning of divergence and
1:3	-	the curl
1:4	-	now divergence and curl once we know
1:6	-	these two concepts it becomes very easy
1:9	-	to understand the physical meaning of
1:11	-	Maxwell's equations so let us start and
1:14	-	before we start make sure you subscribe
1:16	-	our channel because I'll keep on
1:18	-	uploading for more videos on physics so
1:23	-	a first task is to understand the
1:25	-	Gauss's law in electricity and magnetism
1:28	-	in order to understand these two laws we
1:31	-	need to understand what is the meaning
1:33	-	of divergence of a vector field now any
1:37	-	maths textbook will tell you that the
1:39	-	mathematical formulation of divergence
1:42	-	is this but we need to understand the
1:45	-	physical meaning of divergence in order
1:48	-	to understand the Gauss's law so we
1:51	-	consider a vector field G depicted by
1:54	-	these arrows for simplicity I'll assume
1:57	-	that our G is only along the x direction
2:0	-	so we cut out these two components of
2:3	-	the field there is no field along the X
2:6	-	the Z direction and the y direction and
2:9	-	there is no change in these fields along
2:11	-	the z and y directions
2:13	-	field is only along the x-direction now
2:16	-	in in our case I have depicted that the
2:21	-	magnitude of G is increasing along the
2:25	-	increasing x direction in this field
2:27	-	assume that the strength of the field or
2:30	-	the magnitude of the field is directly
2:32	-	proportional to the length of the arrow
2:33	-	so as you can see that the arrows are
2:37	-	here shorter but as they move along the
2:39	-	X direction the arrows get longer this
2:42	-	means the strength of our field or the
2:44	-	magnitude of the field increases in
2:47	-	order to understand what is divergence
2:50	-	what we do is we draw an arbitrary
2:52	-	sphere of any size inside this field it
2:57	-	is not important to draw a sphere only
2:59	-	you can draw any arbitrary curve around
3:2	-	the field as you can see the amount of
3:5	-	field that is entering the sphere is
3:7	-	less as compared to what is coming
3:10	-	outside the field this means that there
3:13	-	is some source that is causing the field
3:16	-	to diverge inside the sphere so the
3:19	-	amount of field that is going inside is
3:21	-	less as compared to what is coming
3:23	-	outside this is known as the positive
3:26	-	divergence now since G has increased as
3:30	-	it was going in in the X direction we
3:33	-	said that the derivative of G with
3:35	-	respect to X is greater than zero and
3:38	-	hence it is known as the positive
3:40	-	divergence when we plug in this value
3:42	-	over here in the second case you can see
3:46	-	that as our field is going in the X
3:49	-	direction the length of the arrow is
3:51	-	decreasing hence the magnitude or the
3:54	-	strength of the field is also decreasing
3:56	-	to understand divergence what we do is
3:59	-	we again draw an arbitrary sphere around
4:2	-	the field as you can see the amount of
4:6	-	field that is going inside the sphere is
4:8	-	more than what is coming outside this
4:11	-	means that there is some sink inside
4:13	-	that sphere that is causing our field to
4:16	-	decrease in magnitude and hence this is
4:19	-	known as the negative divergence now
4:22	-	since G has decreased as it was going
4:25	-	along the x direction
4:27	-	we say that the derivative of G with
4:29	-	respect to X is less than zero and when
4:32	-	we plug this over here we will find that
4:35	-	the divergence of G is negative in the
4:38	-	third case I have shown the case of zero
4:41	-	divergence so what we have is we again
4:44	-	draw an arbitrary sphere over here as
4:46	-	you can see the amount of field that is
4:49	-	going inside is exactly equal to the
4:52	-	amount of field that is coming outside
4:54	-	so this means that nothing is disturbing
4:56	-	our field inside the sphere there is no
4:59	-	source or sink that can affect our field
5:2	-	since G remains constant as it was going
5:5	-	along X we say that the divergence of
5:8	-	the field in this case is exactly zero
5:11	-	so having understood the physical
5:13	-	meaning of divergence we are ready to
5:16	-	finally understand what the Gauss's law
5:18	-	in electricity and magnetism means in
5:21	-	electricity Gauss law the mathematical
5:23	-	form is this now this constant is not
5:26	-	important to understand the physical
5:27	-	meaning of Gauss law so we can set this
5:30	-	to unity this actually is there to
5:33	-	balance the units of the equation Rho is
5:37	-	known as the charge density and E is the
5:40	-	electric field and this is of course the
5:43	-	divergence now if I have a positive
5:46	-	charge like this you know that from a
5:50	-	positive charge the electric field lines
5:52	-	go outside like this so I have a
5:57	-	positive charge which is from where the
6:0	-	electric field lines are coming out and
6:2	-	of course I have also have a negative
6:4	-	charge which is far away from this
6:6	-	charge the positive charge the electric
6:8	-	field lines go inside like this
6:12	-	what Gauss's law really tells is that
6:15	-	the divergence of electric field is
6:18	-	directly proportional to the charge
6:20	-	density so if I draw an imaginary sphere
6:23	-	around this positive charge we can see
6:26	-	that more field lines are going outside
6:29	-	the sphere then what are coming inside
6:32	-	this means that there is the net
6:35	-	positive charge around this sphere so
6:37	-	there is some source of electric field
6:41	-	that is emanating the field outside the
6:43	-	sphere now what happens in case of the
6:46	-	negative charge in case of the negative
6:49	-	charge as you can see all the field
6:51	-	lines are coming in this direction so
6:54	-	what if we draw an imaginary sphere
6:56	-	around the negative charge you can see
6:59	-	that more field lines are entering this
7:1	-	sphere then water coming outside of the
7:4	-	sphere so there is some sink inside this
7:7	-	region that is causing the Magne that is
7:10	-	attracting all the electric field lines
7:12	-	towards this region now in important
7:15	-	property of the Gauss's law says that
7:18	-	there can exist separate electric
7:21	-	charges positive and negative both
7:24	-	positive and negative electric charges
7:26	-	are what caused the electric fields they
7:31	-	can exist in separate they can have
7:33	-	separate existence the positive and the
7:35	-	negative electric charges but what
7:38	-	happens when I draw a positive and a
7:40	-	negative charge together like this for
7:43	-	example in an electric dipole and I draw
7:46	-	the imaginary sphere around this point
7:48	-	now what will be the right-hand side of
7:51	-	this equation it will be 0 why because
7:55	-	the positive charge contributes positive
8:0	-	charge density and the negative charge
8:2	-	contributes negative charge density
8:4	-	these two exactly cancel out each other
8:6	-	because Rho is equivalent to the net
8:10	-	charge that is inside that region so
8:12	-	these two exactly cancel out each other
8:15	-	and we get zero in the case of magnetism
8:19	-	the story becomes a little bit different
8:21	-	what is the source of magnetic field you
8:24	-	will say magnet okay so we draw a magnet
8:28	-	around here with the North and South
8:29	-	Pole we know that the magnetic field
8:32	-	lines outside the magnet start from the
8:35	-	north and end at the sound like this now
8:46	-	in the case of magnetism we again draw
8:49	-	our imaginary sphere like this you can
8:53	-	see that
8:54	-	ammount of magnetic field that is going
8:56	-	inside the sphere is exactly equal to
8:59	-	amount of magnetic field that is coming
9:1	-	outside hence the net divergence of
9:5	-	magnetic field is zero why is this so
9:8	-	because North and South Pole always come
9:11	-	in pairs one is acting as a source of
9:14	-	magnetic field because it has positive
9:16	-	divergence the field lines are coming
9:19	-	outside and the other is acting as a
9:21	-	think of the magnetic field because it
9:24	-	has negative divergence something is
9:26	-	going in so in the case of magnetism the
9:31	-	divergence of magnetic field is zero and
9:33	-	this is what is the Gauss's law in
9:35	-	magnetism this also means that like the
9:39	-	electric field like the electricity
9:41	-	where we can have positive and negative
9:44	-	charges separately we cannot have North
9:47	-	and South Poles separately if that was
9:51	-	the case that is if I had North Pole
9:53	-	separate and South Poles separate North
9:57	-	Pole is giving off the magnetic field
10:0	-	and South Pole is acting as a sync to
10:2	-	the magnetic field then the right-hand
10:5	-	side of this equation would not be zero
10:8	-	it would be something else
10:9	-	hence the mean magnetism the Gauss's law
10:12	-	says that there can be no magnetic
10:15	-	monopoles if you even cut a magnet into
10:18	-	two halves you won't have a separate
10:20	-	North and South Pole what you will have
10:22	-	is two magnets with separate pairs of
10:25	-	North and South Poles now the third one
10:29	-	in our list is the Faraday's law
10:32	-	I personally regard this as the equation
10:35	-	that really changed the course of
10:36	-	history because it tells how the
10:38	-	electric and magnetic fields are linked
10:41	-	with each other theoretically so in
10:44	-	order to understand what the Faraday's
10:46	-	law actually means we need to understand
10:48	-	what is the meaning of curl so imagine
10:51	-	we have a field again we are assuming
10:54	-	that the length of the arrow actually
10:56	-	signifies actually signifies the
10:58	-	strength of the field so our field is
11:1	-	stronger at the top and as we go down it
11:4	-	is decreasing in its strength
11:6	-	if you place a
11:7	-	stick in here like this at the top of
11:11	-	the stick since the field is very strong
11:14	-	it will tend it will exert more of
11:16	-	effect on the upper end than at the
11:18	-	lower end so what will happen is the
11:21	-	feel the stick will tend to rotate
11:23	-	because the amount of effect the effect
11:26	-	that is on the upper end is more than
11:28	-	what is at the lower end and the stick
11:32	-	we tend to rotate like this it will
11:33	-	experience some sort of torque it will
11:36	-	rotate and this is what actually the
11:38	-	curl of a vector field signifies curl
11:41	-	actually represents curl at a particular
11:43	-	point in a vector field actually
11:45	-	represents how much turning effect would
11:48	-	it produce if you were present at that
11:51	-	point so in terms of Faraday's law
11:54	-	imagine you have a round metallic ring
11:56	-	and you pass a time varying magnetic
12:0	-	field through it now what this time
12:3	-	varying magnetic field will do is it
12:5	-	will induce an electric field around
12:8	-	this ring and when you see that the
12:11	-	electric field has been induced it will
12:13	-	cause the electrons to flow in this
12:17	-	metallic ring and you will have a
12:19	-	current not the negative sign signifies
12:22	-	that the induced current is in such a
12:25	-	direction so as to oppose a change in
12:28	-	the magnetic field so Faraday's law
12:31	-	actually gives a relation between a
12:33	-	changing magnetic field and the induced
12:35	-	electric field now the last of the four
12:38	-	equations is the ampere Maxwell law the
12:42	-	mathematical form of ampere Maxwell law
12:44	-	is this I have just excluded the
12:46	-	constants over here because we are
12:49	-	concerned with the physical meaning of
12:51	-	this equation the curl of the magnetic
12:53	-	field is directly proportional to the
12:56	-	current density over here which I have
12:59	-	depicted with J imagine you have a
13:2	-	current carrying wire and you draw a
13:5	-	very small imaginary circle around this
13:9	-	wire that this equation says that around
13:13	-	this current carrying wire the magnetic
13:16	-	field will have a curling direction it
13:19	-	will flow like this
13:20	-	now there is a very prominent
13:23	-	theoretical and experimental flaw in
13:25	-	this equation first I will explain the
13:28	-	theoretical one vector calculus tells us
13:31	-	that the divergence of curl must be zero
13:34	-	so if I take the divergence on both
13:38	-	sides of this equation
13:39	-	I must have zero on both sides
13:42	-	divergence of the curl is zero okay from
13:45	-	the left hand side this implies that
13:48	-	then Lord J should also be zero that is
13:51	-	the divergence or the current density
13:53	-	should also be 0 but the continuity
13:56	-	equation in electro dynamics says that
13:59	-	the curl of the Magna carte density is
14:3	-	equal to negative of the rate of change
14:7	-	of charge density this means that the
14:10	-	divergence of current density is nonzero
14:13	-	this is a paradoxical situation because
14:15	-	it is violating the left and right hand
14:18	-	side of this equation left hand side is
14:20	-	zero but the right hand side the
14:22	-	divergence of J is nonzero
14:24	-	this was the theoretical flow in terms
14:27	-	of the experimental flow consider
14:30	-	charging a capacitor now I have drawn an
14:34	-	imaginary shape which starts from
14:37	-	outside the capacitor goes inside and
14:40	-	ends up again over here it is a closed
14:43	-	loop current is entering the side one
14:46	-	but it is not leaving side two because
14:49	-	inside the capacitor current does not
14:52	-	flow so we have a net divergence of J
14:56	-	the net divergence of J is to be
15:1	-	considered over here
15:2	-	this was the turret experimental flow
15:5	-	the only thing that is changing inside
15:8	-	the capacitor is the electric field as
15:10	-	the charge is accumulating on this phase
15:12	-	the electric field is changing inside
15:15	-	the capacitor with time so Maxwell says
15:18	-	if we add another term 1 by C square
15:22	-	Kerli ebike early t to the right-hand
15:26	-	side of the amperes law
15:28	-	now I'm again adding the unit over here
15:30	-	because I just added the unit here so
15:33	-	he's
15:34	-	that if you add this term on the
15:36	-	right-hand side it will perfectly
15:38	-	balance the equation both theoretically
15:41	-	and experimentally this term has added a
15:45	-	beautiful symmetry to the Maxwell's
15:47	-	equations Faraday's law told that with
15:50	-	the changing magnetic field with time we
15:53	-	had a curling electric field here if you
15:57	-	have a changing electric field with time
15:59	-	you have a curling magnetic field this
16:2	-	is the level of symmetry we have
16:4	-	achieved in Maxwell's equations by
16:6	-	adding this term so this was all about
16:9	-	the Maxwell's equations make sure you
16:12	-	subscribe our channel and asked
16:14	-	questions regarding any topic of physics
16:18	-	thank you
