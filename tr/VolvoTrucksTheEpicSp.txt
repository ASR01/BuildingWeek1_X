Description:	Watch Jean-Claude Van Damme carry out his famous split between two reversing trucks. Never done before, JCVD says it's the most epic of splits -- what do you think? Please share & comment! 

This live test was set up to demonstrate the precision and directional stability of Volvo Dynamic Steering -- a world first technology that makes the Volvo FM easier to drive. 

Filmed in Spain on a closed-off landing field at sunrise in one take.

Directed by Andreas Nilsson
Soundtrack by Enya: Only Time
