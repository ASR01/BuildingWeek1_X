The first proof goes back to Greek times, due to Archimedes, who was charmed by the fact that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of a cylinder encompassing it, and 2/3 the surface area as well (if you consider the caps).  Check out this video for another beautiful animation of that first proof:

Transcription:
 0:03	-	Some of you may have seen in school that thesurface area of a sphere is 4pi*R^2, a suspiciously
0:09	-	suggestive formula given that it’s an cleanmultiple of pi*R^2, the area of a circle with
0:15	-	the same radius. But have you ever wonderedwhy is this true? And I don’t just mean
0:20	-	proving this 4pi*R^2 formula, I mean viscerallyfeeling a connection between this surface
0:26	-	area, and these four circles.
0:29	-	How lovely would it be if there was some shiftin perspective that showed how you could nicely
0:33	-	and perfectly fit these four circles ontothe sphere’s surface? Nothing can be quite
0:39	-	that simple, since the curvature of a sphere’ssurface is different from the curvature of
0:43	-	a flat plane, which is why trying to fit paperaround a sphere doesn’t really work. Nevertheless,
0:51	-	I’d like to show you two ways of thinkingabout this surface area connecting it in a
0:56	-	satisfying way to these circles. The firstis a classic, one of the true gems of geometry
1:02	-	all students should experience. The secondline of reasoning is something of my own which
1:10	-	draws a more direct line between the sphereand its shadow.
1:14	-	And lastly I’ll share why this four-foldrelation is not unique to spheres, but is
1:19	-	instead one specific instance of a much moregeneral fact for all convex shapes in 3d.
1:26	-	Starting with a birds eye view here, the ideafor the first approach is to show that the
1:29	-	surface area of the sphere is the same asthe area of a cylinder with the same radius
1:35	-	and the same height as the sphere. Or rather,a cylinder without its top and bottom, what
1:40	-	you might call the “label” of that cylinder.With that, we can unwrap that label to understand
1:46	-	it as a simple rectangle.
1:49	-	The width of this rectangle comes from thecylinder’s circumference, so it’s 2*pi*R,
1:55	-	and the height comes from the height of thesphere, which is 2R. This already gives the
2:01	-	formula, 4pi*R^2, but in the spirit of mathematicalplayfulness it’s nice to see how four circles
2:08	-	with radius R fit into this. The idea is thatyou can unwrap each circle into a triangle,
2:16	-	without changing its area, and fit these nicelyonto our unfolded cylinder label. More on
2:22	-	that in a bit.
2:23	-	The more pressing question is why on earththe sphere can be related to the cylinder.
2:28	-	This animation is already suggestive of howthis works. The idea is to approximate the
2:35	-	area of the sphere with many tiny rectanglescovering it, and to show how if you project
2:41	-	those little rectangles directly outward,as if casting a shadow by little lights positioned
2:46	-	on the z-axis pointing parallel to the xyplane, the projection of each rectangle on
2:52	-	the cylinder, quite surprisingly, ends uphaving the same area as the original rectangle.
2:58	-	But why should that be? Well, there are twocompeting effects at play here. For one of
3:05	-	these rectangles, let’s call the side alongthe latitude lines its width, and the side
3:09	-	along the longitude lines its height. On theone hand, as this rectangle is projected outward,
3:15	-	its width will get scaled up. For rectanglestowards the poles, that length is scaled quite
3:23	-	a bit, since they’re projected over a longerdistance. For those closer to the equator,
3:31	-	less so
3:34	-	But on the other hand, because these rectanglesare at a slant with respect to the z-direction,
3:39	-	during this projection the height of eachsuch rectangle will get scaled down. Think
3:45	-	about holding some flat object and lookingat its shadow. As you reorient that object,
3:50	-	the shadow looks more or less squished forsome angles. Those rectangles towards the
3:55	-	poles are quite slanted in this way, so theirheight gets squished a lot. For those closer
4:02	-	to the equator, less so.
4:07	-	It will turn out that these two effects, ofstretching the width and squishing the height,
4:13	-	cancel each other out perfectly.
4:16	-	Already as a rough sketch, wouldn’t youagree this is a very pretty way of reasoning?
4:20	-	Of course, the meat here comes from showingwhy these two competing effects on each rectangle
4:25	-	cancel out perfectly. In some ways, the detailsfleshing this out are just as pretty as the
4:29	-	zoomed out structure of the full argument.
4:34	-	Let me go ahead and cut away half the sphereso we get get a better look. For any mathematical
4:39	-	problem solving it never hurts to start bygiving names to things. Let’s say the radius
4:44	-	of the sphere is R. Focus on one specificrectangle, and let’s call the distance between
4:50	-	our rectangle and the z-axis is d. You couldcomplain that this distance d is a little
4:56	-	ambiguous depending on which point of therectangle you’re going from, but for tinier
5:01	-	and tinier rectangles that ambiguity willbe negligible. And tinier and tinier is when
5:07	-	this approximation-with-rectangles gets closerto the true surface area anyway. To choose
5:12	-	an arbitrary standard let’s say d is thedistance from the bottom of the rectangle.
5:17	-	To think about projecting out to the cylinder,picture two similar triangles. This first
5:24	-	one shares its base with the base of the rectangleon the sphere, and has a tip at the same height
5:30	-	on the z-axis a distance d-away. The secondis a scaled up version of this, scaled so
5:37	-	that it just barely reaches the cylinder,meaning its long side now has length R. So
5:43	-	the ratio of their bases, which is how muchour rectangle’s width gets stretched out,
5:48	-	is R/d.
5:52	-	What about the height? How precisely doesthat get scaled down as we project? Again,
5:57	-	let’s slice a cross section here. In fact,why don’t we go ahead and completely focus
6:02	-	our view to this 2d cross section.
6:05	-	To think about the projection, let’s makea little right triangle like this, where what
6:10	-	was the height of our spherical rectangleis the hypotenuse, and its projection is one
6:15	-	of the legs. Pro tip, anytime you’re doinggeometry with circles or spheres, keep at
6:21	-	the forefront of your mind that anything tangentto the circle is perpendicular to the radius
6:26	-	drawn to that point of tangency. It’s crazyhow helpful that one little fact can be. Once
6:34	-	we draw that radial line, together with thedistance d we have another right triangle.
6:41	-	Often in geometry, I like to imagine tweakingthe parameters of a setup and imagining how
6:45	-	the relevant shapes change; this helps tomake guesses about what relations there are.
6:51	-	In this case, you might predict that the twotriangles I’ve drawn are similar to each
6:55	-	other, since their shapes change in concertwith each other. This is indeed true, but
7:01	-	as always, don’t take my word for it, seeif you can justify this for yourself.
7:06	-	Again, it never hurts to give more names tothings. Maybe call this angle alpha and this
7:12	-	one beta. Since this is a right triangle,you know that alpha + beta + 90 degrees = 180
7:20	-	degrees. Now zoom in to our little triangle,and see if we can figure out its angles. You
7:28	-	have 90 degrees + beta + (some angle) forminga straight line. So that little angle must
7:40	-	be alpha. This lets us fill in a few morevalues, revealing that this little triangle
7:47	-	has the same angles, alpha and beta, as thebig one. So they are indeed similar.
7:53	-	Deep in the weeds it’s sometimes easy toforget why we’re doing this. We want to
7:59	-	know how much the height of our sphere-rectanglegets squished during this projection, which
8:04	-	is the ratio of this hypotenuse to the legon the right. By the similarity with the big
8:11	-	triangle, that ratio is R/d.
8:14	-	So indeed, as this rectangle gets projectedoutward onto the cylinder, the effect of stretching
8:20	-	out the width is perfectly canceled out byhow much the height gets squished due to the
8:25	-	slant.
8:26	-	As a fun sidenote, you might notice that itlooks like the projected rectangle is a 90
8:31	-	degree rotation of the original. This wouldnot be true in general, but by a lovely coincidence,
8:37	-	the way I’m parametrizing the sphere resultsin rectangles where the ratio of the width
8:42	-	the the height starts out as d to R. So forthis very specific case, rescaling the width
8:48	-	by R/d and the height by d/R actually doeshave the same effect as a 90 degree rotation.
8:57	-	This lends itself to a rather bizarre wayto animate the relation, where instead of
9:00	-	projecting each rectangular piece, you rotateeach one and rearrange them to make the cylinder.
9:12	-	Now, if you’re really thinking critically,you might still not be satisfied that this
9:20	-	shows that the surface area of the sphereequals the area of this cylinder label since
9:24	-	these little rectangles only approximate therelevant areas. Well, the idea is that this
9:29	-	approximation gets closer and closer to thetrue value for finer and finer coverings.
9:35	-	Since for any specific covering, the sphererectangles have the same area as the cylinder
9:40	-	rectangles, whatever values each of thesetwo series of approximations are approaching
9:45	-	must actually be the same.
9:47	-	I mean, as you get really aggressively philosophicalabout what we even mean by surface area, these
9:53	-	sorts of rectangular approximations and notjust aids in our problem-solving toolbox,
9:57	-	they end up serving as a way of rigorouslydefining the area of smooth curved surfaces.
10:05	-	This kind of reasoning is essentially calculus,just stated without any of the jargon. In
10:09	-	fact, I think neat geometric arguments likethis, which require no background in calculus
10:14	-	to understand, can serve as a great way totee things up for new calculus students so
10:19	-	that they have the core ideas before seeingthe definitions which make them precise, rather
10:24	-	than the other way around.Unfold circle
10:28	-	So as I said before, if you’re itching tosee a direct connection to four circles, one
10:34	-	nice way is to unwrap these circles into triangles.If this is something you haven’t seen before,
10:40	-	I go into much more detail about why thisworks in the first video of the calculus series.
10:45	-	The basic idea is to relate thin concentricrings of the circle with horizontal slices
10:51	-	of this triangle. Because that circumferenceof each such ring increases linearly in proportion
10:57	-	to the radius, always 2pi times that radius,when you unwrap them all and line them up,
11:03	-	their ends will form a straight line, givingyou a triangle with a base of 2pi*R, and a
11:11	-	height of R, as opposed to some other curvedshape.
11:13	-	And four of these unwrapped circles fit intoour rectangle, which is in some sense an unwrapped
11:19	-	version of the sphere’s surface.Second proof
11:23	-	Nevertheless, you might wonder if there’sa way than this to relate the sphere directly
11:28	-	to a circle with the same radius, rather thangoing through this intermediary of the cylinder.
11:32	-	I do have a proof for you to this effect,leveraging a little trigonometry, though I
11:37	-	have to admit I still think the comparisonto the cylinder wins out on elegance.
11:40	-	I’m a big believer that the best way toreally learn math is to do problems yourself,
11:47	-	which is a bit hypocritical coming from achannel essentially consisting of lectures.
11:50	-	So I’m going to try something a little differenthere and present the proof as a heavily guided
11:55	-	sequence of exercises. Yes, I know that’sless fun and it means you have to pull out
12:00	-	some paper to do some work, but I guaranteeyou’ll get more out of it this way.
12:06	-	The approach will be to cut the sphere intomany rings parallel to the xy plane, and to
12:12	-	compare the area of these rings to the areaof their shadows on the xy plane. All the
12:19	-	shadows of the rings from the northern hemispheremake up a circle with the same radius as the
12:23	-	sphere, right? The main idea will be to showa correspondence between these ring shadows,
12:29	-	and every other ring on the sphere. Challengemode here is to pause now and see if you can
12:35	-	predict how that might go.
12:38	-	We’ll label each one of these rings basedon the angle theta between a line from the
12:44	-	sphere’s center to the ring and the z-axis.So theta ranges from 0 to 180 degrees, which
12:54	-	is to say from 0 to pi radians. And let’scall the change in angle from one ring to
12:59	-	the next d-theta, which means the thicknessof one of these rings with be the radius,
13:05	-	R, times d-theta.
13:06	-	Alright, structured exercise time. We’llease in with a warm-up
13:12	-	Question #1: What is the circumference ofthis ring at the inner edge, in terms of R
13:19	-	and theta? Go ahead and multiply your answerthe thickness R*d-theta to get an approximation
13:28	-	for this ring’s area; and approximationthat gets better and better as you chop up
13:32	-	the sphere more and more finely.
13:36	-	At this point, if you know your calculus,you could integrate. But our goal is not just
13:42	-	to find the answer, it’s to feel the connectionbetween the sphere its shadow. So…
13:49	-	Question #2: What is the area of the shadowof one of these rings on the xy-plane? Again,
13:55	-	expressed in terms of R, theta and d-theta.
14:09	-	Question #3: Each of these ring shadows hasprecisely half the area of one of these rings
14:16	-	on the sphere. It’s not the one at angletheta straight above it, but another one.
14:23	-	Which one?(As a hint, you might want to reference some
14:26	-	trig identities)Question #4: I said in the outset there is
14:37	-	a correspondence between all the shadows fromthe northern hemisphere, which make up a circle
14:41	-	with radius R, and every other ring on thesphere. Use your answer to the last question
14:47	-	to spell out exactly what that correspondenceis.
14:57	-	Question #5: Bring it on home, why does thisimply that the area of the circle is exactly
15:01	-	¼ the surface area of the sphere, particularlyas we consider thinner and thinner rings?
15:08	-	If you want answers or hints, I’m quitesure people in the comments and on reddit
15:12	-	will have them waiting for you.
15:15	-	And finally, I’d be remiss not to make abrief mention of the fact that the surface
15:19	-	area of a sphere is a specific instance ofa much more general fact: If you take any
15:25	-	convex shape, and look at the average areaof all its shadows, averaged over all possible
15:31	-	orientations in 3d space, the surface areaof the solid will be precisely 4 times that
15:37	-	average shadow area.
15:39	-	As to why this is true, I’ll leave thosedetails for another day.
15:47	-	Hey, given the time of year I thought I’dtake a moment to let you know about some new
15:54	-	additions to the 3blue1brown store. Asidefrom the usual fare, like shirts, mugs and
15:59	-	posters, there are now some Fourier Seriessocks, which show certain periodic functions
16:04	-	graphed on a cylinder, the way all periodicfunctions wish they were graphed.
16:08	-	And, by popular demand, there are the plushiepi creatures, both ordinary and extra plushified.
16:14	-	I’ll admit that I was initially skepticalwhen people asked about them, because, you
16:19	-	know, what would you do with one, exactly?But after getting them, and seeing the pictures
16:24	-	people would send, what I realized is theybasically serve the same function as a flag.
16:29	-	Just instead of representing loyalty to acountry, or even to the channel per se, it’s
16:34	-	to math, and the idea that math has some personalityto it, more so than it often gets credit for.
