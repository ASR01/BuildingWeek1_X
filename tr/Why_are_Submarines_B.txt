Transcription:
 00:00   -    what if we were to tell you that modern
 00:02   -    submarines are black
 00:03   -    for the same reason the tires and your
 00:05   -    car are black
 00:06   -    that's right but before the rubber meets
 00:09   -    the road we need to talk about
 00:10   -    submarines and camouflage
 00:13   -    before the invention of nuclear power
 00:15   -    submarines actually spent more time on
 00:17   -    the surface than underwater
 00:19   -    and so camouflaging was essential during
 00:22   -    world war 1
 00:23   -    the united states conducted experiments
 00:25   -    in order to protect their submarines
 00:27   -    against visual detection
 00:29   -    the results showed that for a surfaced
 00:31   -    submarine
 00:32   -    a light gray hull with black decks
 00:35   -    provided as good of a visual protection
 00:37   -    as any other method but in the mid 30s
 00:40   -    another issue arose as it became
 00:42   -    apparent that submerged submarines
 00:44   -    can be observed by aircraft flying over
 00:46   -    them as long as the submarines were not
 00:48   -    too deep down
 00:50   -    looking for a solution the united states
 00:52   -    conducted another series of tests
 00:54   -    in 1937 at pearl harbor as part of the
 00:58   -    experiments
 00:58   -    submarines were painted black dark blue
 01:01   -    purple
 01:01   -    green and various other combination of
 01:04   -    colors
 01:04   -    the conclusion was that dark blue
 01:07   -    offered the best concealment
 01:08   -    in deep clear tropical waters and the
 01:11   -    commander ordered his division to
 01:13   -    repaint the submarine's
 01:14   -    dark blue but as the camouflage testing
 01:17   -    continued
 01:17   -    a new problem surfaced as the blue paint
 01:20   -    deteriorated after application
 01:22   -    and acquired a lighter milky tone in the
 01:25   -    end the decision to paint submarines
 01:27   -    black
 01:27   -    was made due to the superior durability
 01:30   -    of black paint
 01:31   -    and not because of black color's
 01:33   -    camouflaging characteristics
 01:35   -    fast forwarding to 2006 the royal navy
 01:39   -    painted hms torbay a new shade called
 01:42   -    steely blue
 01:43   -    as after conducting exhaustive trials
 01:45   -    and lab tests
 01:46   -    they found out that black was the worst
 01:48   -    low-key color
 01:49   -    to deceive the enemy while black color
 01:52   -    did perform in darker north atlantic
 01:54   -    waters
 01:55   -    in brighter seas the new blue shade was
 01:57   -    twice as hard to spot
 01:59   -    hms torbay was sent on a six-month
 02:02   -    secret mission to test out this new
 02:04   -    color and it was expected that the
 02:05   -    entire fleet of royal navy submarines
 02:08   -    would be repainted
 02:09   -    steely blue but something must have been
 02:11   -    discovered during the testing of the
 02:13   -    steely blue shade as the royal navy's
 02:16   -    newest astute-class submarines are still
 02:18   -    black
 02:19   -    here is a random fact hms torbay was the
 02:22   -    first british warship to be controlled
 02:24   -    using microsoft windows operating system
 02:26   -    which was the
 02:28   -    i wonder if that's what steely blue
 02:31   -    looks like
 02:32   -    here comes the interesting part it
 02:33   -    appears that most modern submarines
 02:36   -    are not painted at all instead they're
 02:38   -    covered with anechoic tiles which happen
 02:40   -    to be black
 02:42   -    anechoic tiles are predominantly made of
 02:44   -    rubber that contains
 02:45   -    thousands of tiny voids which have two
 02:47   -    unique properties
 02:48   -    they absorb the sound waves of active
 02:50   -    sonar thereby reducing its effective
 02:53   -    range
 02:53   -    and they also decrease the sound emitted
 02:56   -    from the vessel itself
 02:57   -    like engine noises which reduces
 02:59   -    detection range by passive sonar
 03:02   -    just to give you an idea about the sound
 03:03   -    absorption properties of the anechoic
 03:05   -    tiles
 03:06   -    back in 2009 hms vanguard and french
 03:09   -    navy's triumphant were traveling at low
 03:11   -    speeds in the atlantic ocean
 03:13   -    the anechoic tiles were so effective
 03:16   -    that neither submarine's passive sonar
 03:18   -    detected the other submarine
 03:20   -    resulting in them colliding into one
 03:22   -    another
 03:23   -    anechoic tiles were first used by
 03:25   -    germans as early as 1940
 03:27   -    under u-boats by 1970 soviets
 03:31   -    started covering their submarines by 4
 03:33   -    inch or 10 centimeter thick rubber tiles
 03:36   -    and that helped reduce the akula class
 03:38   -    submarine's acoustic signature
 03:40   -    by 10 to 20 decibels by the 1980s
 03:43   -    both the royal navy and the us navy
 03:46   -    started utilizing the anechoic tiles
 03:48   -    but why are the anechoic tiles black
 03:51   -    answering this question
 03:53   -    is key to understanding why modern
 03:55   -    submarines are black
 03:57   -    anechoic tiles are typically made of
 03:59   -    rubber but believe it or not
 04:01   -    rubber's natural color is white for
 04:03   -    instance
 04:04   -    over a century ago all the tires on cars
 04:06   -    were actually white
 04:08   -    just like this ford model t which begs
 04:10   -    the question
 04:11   -    if rubber is white why are tires black
 04:14   -    and it's time to say it's not what you
 04:17   -    think
 04:18   -    what makes tires black is the addition
 04:20   -    of carbon black to the rubber
 04:22   -    carbon black is often used as color
 04:24   -    pigment in paints
 04:26   -    but tires are black not for cosmetic
 04:28   -    reasons
 04:29   -    but because adding carbon black to the
 04:31   -    rubber mixture
 04:32   -    increases the tensile strength and the
 04:34   -    roadway abrasion resistance of the tire
 04:37   -    by over 10 times
 04:38   -    in fact carbon black is mainly used as a
 04:41   -    reinforcing filler
 04:42   -    due to its unique property of making
 04:44   -    things more durable
 04:45   -    and this is why all rubber products
 04:47   -    where tensile and abrasion wear
 04:49   -    properties are important
 04:50   -    contain carbon black and thus are black
 04:53   -    in color
 04:54   -    carbon black is also the reason why
 04:56   -    black paint is much more durable than
 04:58   -    other colors
 04:59   -    but we are not quite done with carbon
 05:01   -    black since a submarine experiences
 05:03   -    extreme pressure differences as it
 05:05   -    submerges and resurfaces
 05:07   -    the anechoic tiles are under a lot of
 05:09   -    pressure so using carbon black filler in
 05:12   -    the rubber mixture
 05:13   -    makes a lot of sense moreover research
 05:15   -    shows that carbon black reinforced
 05:17   -    rubber has the best sound absorption
 05:19   -    performance
 05:20   -    when compared to rubbers that use other
 05:22   -    reinforcing fillers
 05:24   -    while the exact composition of anechoic
 05:26   -    tiles used on submarines is not public
 05:28   -    knowledge
 05:29   -    during our research of academic papers
 05:32   -    we found that the amount of carbon black
 05:34   -    added to the mixture
 05:35   -    influences the tile's sound absorption
 05:37   -    properties
 05:38   -    since various parts of the submarine
 05:40   -    produce different sound frequencies
 05:42   -    a variety of different and echoic tiles
 05:44   -    are attached to the different parts of
 05:46   -    the submarine
 05:47   -    if you're interested in the research
 05:49   -    check out the references in the video
 05:50   -    description
 05:51   -    but one last question remains if dark
 05:54   -    blue
 05:54   -    is the best camouflage color why not
 05:56   -    paint the anechoic tiles
 05:58   -    dark blue and also why are the bottoms
 06:00   -    of some submarines
 06:01   -    red well the exact details around the
 06:04   -    stealth properties of submarines are not
 06:06   -    publicly available
 06:07   -    north korea and iran paint their
 06:09   -    submarines green
 06:10   -    and israel paints theirs blue go figure
 06:13   -    but
 06:14   -    there might be a dilemma about painting
 06:16   -    submarines in general
 06:18   -    if you paint the tiles it seems to
 06:20   -    negatively impact the sonar stealth
 06:22   -    properties of the submarine
 06:24   -    but if you don't paint them organic life
 06:26   -    like algae and barnacles will slowly
 06:28   -    cover
 06:29   -    the bottom of the submarine which over
 06:31   -    time has a similar negative
 06:32   -    impact that said if the bottom is to be
 06:35   -    painted
 06:36   -    anti-fouling paint such as cupro's oxide
 06:39   -    is used a red chemical compound which
 06:41   -    slows down the growth of organisms which
 06:44   -    is why the bottom of submarines and
 06:45   -    ships in general
 06:47   -    is red oh and the cruise ships are white
 06:49   -    or mostly white
 06:50   -    because that's a color that best
 06:52   -    reflects the sun's energy
 06:53   -    keeping air conditioning costs to a
 06:55   -    minimum this video was brought to you by
